## Spring Redis Cache Test

This project was some test code developed in order to see
if Spring Data Redis Cache could be used to provide a State that could be used
across a number of Application Servers.

In Order to test this I created 2 instances of the app, one on default port 8080 and another on port 8090

I've also included the postman collections for the commands I used to test.
